          Home remodeling is my passion. With over 20 years of commercial and
          residential construction and project management experience, Avanti
          Enterprises is here to serve you. I am a master of my trade, with home
          remodeling experience from all over North Texas. Nothing makes me
          happier than sharing my design ideas and creating custom spaces for
          homeowners in Dallas and the surrounding counties. I am involved in
          every step of the project, from the moment a client calls, until they
          stand in front of the finished project with a smile on their face.
